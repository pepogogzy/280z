        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>The Nissan S30 is the first generation of Z GT two-seat coupes, produced by Nissan Motors, Ltd. of Japan from 1969 to 1978. One of the most successful sports car lines ever produced, the trend-setting S30 was designed by a team led by Yoshihiko Matsuo, the head of Nissan's Sports Car Styling Studio. The nissan 280z is the latest and greatest member of the S30 family. It was first introduced to the market in 1976 and it sure was a big hit. It was supposed to be younger brother to the 240z and the 260z. It came with a 2.8 liter inline 6 engine producing around 150 horsepower, which for that time was a lot. But today, the engine could be easily swapped for a 2JZ and with some minor tweaks it could become a 600hp beast.</p>
